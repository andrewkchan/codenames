During COVID, we wanted to play codenames online but I thought the website my friend found (https://www.horsepaste.com/) sucked. I made a better multiplayer codenames over a couple days after work, taking around 6 hours total. It's really badly written code using JS practices which were already somewhat outdated in 2020.

It features:
- Turn-based codenames
- Private rooms with shareable URLs
- Players choose their team and their role of spy or spymaster at the beginning of each game
- Spymaster can see the board and gives a hint
- Spies cannot see the board and vote on words (all spies must agree on a word to win)

Here is what it looks like:
